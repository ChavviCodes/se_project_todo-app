# Simple Todo App

This is a straightforward todo app that allows users to add and delete tasks with optional due dates. Each todo item includes a checkbox to mark it as completed, helping users easily track their progress. A live counter displays how many tasks have been completed out of the total, providing a clear overview of whatâ€™s left to do.

## Functionality

Add Todo Items: Users can create new tasks with optional due dates.

Delete Items: Tasks can be removed individually.

Completion Tracking: Each task includes a checkbox to mark it as complete or incomplete.

Progress Counter: A dynamic counter displays the number of completed tasks out of the total.

Due Dates: Optional due dates help users stay organized and prioritize tasks.

## Technology

Object-Oriented Programming: The app is structured using OOP principles with loosely coupled classes to promote modularity and reusability.

DOM Manipulation: All user interactions dynamically update the DOM without page reloads.

Event Handling: Click and input events are handled through listeners attached to relevant elements for responsive interaction.

Clean Code Practices: Naming conventions, method abstraction, and code readability were prioritized to ensure clarity and scalability.
